Typo 5.1.3 is the fourth release of the "Cartier-Bresson" series and released on sunday August the 31th. It is mostly a bugfix and behaviour fix version, so don't expect many changes.

Bug #1244: error with postgresql database on admin/content
Bug #1251: Documentation on dashboard is 404
Bug #1252: migrations alter updated_at timestamps of articles and comments, affects RSS feeds
Bug #1253: Twice redirect in admin/user#list if no admin
Bug #1254: Fix little error when you use bad id in AdminUser#edit
Bug #1255: Doesn't autosave if no define title
Bug #1256: /article/ 301 redirect hits the default buffer which is not the expected behaviour
Bug #1257: Articles redirect doesn't work with non-nil relative_url_root


Rev #1784: Fixed requirements and added our official Typo mascot
Rev #1786: Fixes a stupid behaviour that forces tags display name to be the same as the name in the url. IE : "web 2.0" would display on a page as web2-0 after transformation, which is stupid. Adds a migration that changes '.' into '-' in tag already in the database. Otherwise, it makes typo crash when accessing that tag. Allows edition of tag display name in the admin.
Rev #1787:Removes database dependencies from installer. Now we assume you already have MySQL, PgSQL or SQLLite adater installed. Deletes 2 themes from FCKEditor, about 300k lighter now. Suppress caching from development environment
Rev #1789: Fixes a stupid bug that allows a non administrative user to change his profile
Rev #1792: Removing tmcode textfilter. It now has its own life at http://svn.typosphere.org/plugins/typo_textfilter_tmcode/. Removing amazon textfilter. It now has its own life at http://svn.typosphere.org/plugins/typo_textfilter_amazon/. Removing sparkline textfilter. It now has its own life at http://svn.typosphere.org/plugins/typo_textfilter_sparkline/
Rev #1795: Fixes 2 nasty bugs with autosave. The first one broke autosave when no title was set. We now set a default title. The second one was overriding permalink with a void string when post was autosaved because the permalink field was empty after autosave. For autosave: If no title is given, Typo gives it a title like "Article Draft + post_id". When publishing, every article-draft-something permalink is just replaced with the article title crafted permalink.
Rev #1796: Enables in admin database migration back, gets rid of the old pre 4.1 general controller, sets the CHANGELOG for 5.1.3.
