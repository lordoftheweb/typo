Typo 5.1 "Cartier-Bresson" was released on sunday July the 20th at around 1AM and can be considered as a major Typo Version.

It contains :


** Multiple users and roles. 

This point actually makes Typo 5.1 a major version. This release introduces 3 roles, coming along with various privileges :
– Administrator, who owns full administrative and publishing power.
– Publisher, who owns full publishing power on his own contents.
– Contributors, who only have the right to login and edit their profile.

There is now an option to allow new users to register by themselves or not. If not, the administrator will just have to add them himself in the admin.


** Improved admin

The admin has been heavily refactored to be lighter, easier to use, and offer more capabilities. 
– You can now save your posts as drafts. Drafts now appear in a separate area of your administration to separarte them from offline posts.
– New editing interface.
– Tag autocompletion.
– A new dashboard that makes daily administration easier.
– Save as draft capabilities
– Autosave capabilities (only with simple visual editor)
– Revamped UI
